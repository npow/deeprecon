## What is DeepRecon?

DeepRecon is an AI-powered competitive intelligence platform that helps startup founders discover market opportunities and validate ideas. It pre-computes interactive landscape maps across startup verticals, scores white-space opportunities, and generates deep-dive due diligence reports.

**Two modes of use:**

1. **Browse** — Explore pre-computed market maps across verticals (AI/ML, Fintech, DevTools, etc.) to find gaps before you even have an idea
2. **Scan** — Paste a startup idea and get a full competitive analysis with landscape, gap analysis, VC-grade DD report, and pivot suggestions

## Features

### Market Maps

- **Vertical landscapes** with all major players, funding flows, and sub-category taxonomy
- **Crowdedness Score** (0-100) per sub-vertical — composite of player count, funding deployed, and recent entry rate
- **Opportunity Score** — composite of gap density, complaint volume, funding gaps, and trend growth
- **5 visualization modes** — Landscape cards, Quadrant matrix, Strategy Canvas, Opportunity Scatter, and Grid view
- **Sub-category deep dives** — drill into any segment to see every player with funding, team size, and trend signals

### Multi-Provider Parallel Research

- Fans out to **11+ AI providers** simultaneously (Claude, GPT-5, Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen, GLM, Kimi)
- Each provider's results are **merged incrementally** — data saves to disk as each provider completes
- Real-time SSE progress tracking with per-provider status, token counts, and phase indicators
- Automatic deduplication of players and sub-categories across providers

### Competitive Scans

- **5-stage pipeline**: intent extraction → competitive analysis → gap analysis → DD report → pivot suggestions
- Full DD report covering ICP, problem severity, wedge strategy, TAM/SAM/SOM, business model, defensibility, and GTM
- Multi-layer scoring: **Readiness**, **Lucrativeness**, **Validation**, and blended **Opportunity** score
- Validation gating: pass/watch/fail guardrails for distribution access, buyer budget fit, evidence quality, and live demand signals
- Configurable depth (quick/standard/deep) and competitor count
- Markdown export (copy or download)

### Turbo Populate

- One-click bulk generation of all vertical maps
- Optional vertical discovery — AI proposes new verticals you haven't mapped yet
- Parallel generation + enrichment with concurrency control

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- An API key for at least one AI provider

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/recon.git
cd recon

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your API keys:

```bash
# Required — at least one AI provider
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
```

Postgres persistence (recommended):

```bash
# Preferred
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:5432/dbname

# Or standard PG* vars
PGHOST=host
PGPORT=5432
PGUSER=user
PGPASSWORD=password
PGDATABASE=dbname
```

When Postgres is configured, DeepRecon persists maps, DD scans, scan jobs, and feed data in Postgres.  
When Postgres is not configured, it falls back to local JSON files under `data/`.

Redis throttling (recommended for production):

```bash
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
SCAN_REDIS_PREFIX=deeprecon
SCAN_QUEUE_POLL_MS=250
```

With Redis configured, scan rate limits and queue throttling survive app restarts/deployments.

### Run

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build && npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Key Patterns

- **SSE streaming** on all generation endpoints — real-time progress from server to client
- **Incremental merging** — each provider's results save immediately, no waiting for all to finish
- **Postgres-backed persistence** — maps, scans, feed summaries, and scan jobs persist in Postgres when configured
- **Local file fallback** — JSON files under `/data/` are used only when DB env vars are not configured
- **Parallel fanout** — single prompt sent to multiple LLM providers via OpenAI-compatible proxy, results deduplicated and merged
